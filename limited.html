                        Notre Dame Outward Bound Adventure Club is excited to announce the flagship event of 6th NAF, Alice In Borderland. Inspired by the series, this event is a survival-based game; the last one to remain wins the whole game show. For those who are familiar with playing cards,
                         there are a total of 52 cards in a deck. But hold on a minute, 
                         this is obviously not a typical board game. 
                        <!-- <br><br> <span class=" limited"> <mark> This is one of our limited slot events. Only the first 100 participants to register for this particular segment can be

                        In this event, every card of the deck represents a game with a certain 
                         level and genre. A hearts game identifies as a game of betrayal, where you play with the participant's trust and 
                         a wrong move shall push you towards elimination. On the contrary, a clubs game represents teamwork.
                         Want to survive here? Work as a team, connect everyone's wit and strength. 
                         A diamond game is a game of intelligence and probability. In order to clear this genre, one must think out of the 
                         box! Lastly, a game of spades is a game of ultimate physicality and strength. The numbers 2-10, Jack, Queen, 
                         King and Ace resemble the difficulty of the games. A number 2 card is the easiest level and games gradually get 
                         harder as we proceed through the ascending order of the power or the cards up until The Ace card which is the 
                         toughest game of that respective genre. So to put you guys clear, a jack-of-hearts game is the 4th toughest game of 
                         betrayal and trust. As a deck of cards holds a total of 52 cards, there can be 52 possible games, where every genre 
                         has 13 games of its own. We will randomly hold games out of these 52. We're thrilled to host the first ever series 
                         based multiple game show in Bangladesh and eager for your active participation as the first to experience it!

                        <br>
                        The core concept of the game is that there will be an object in the middle of the playing surface, such as a ball or a foam block. The game is played between two teams each consisting of 4 players. Every player of each team will be assigned a number from one to four without the opponents knowing. When one of those number is called out, the assigned player with that number from each team runs to the center of the playing area and tries to grab hold of the ball and bring it back to their team’s side without the ball being touched by the opposing player.If a player is successful in stealing the ball and making it back to their team’s side, they earn a point for their team. If the ball is tagged by the opponent, the other team earns the point. The game continues with different numbers being called out until a predetermined number of points is reached, or until a designated time limit is up.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In conclusion, the game offers a unique and engaging experience for players of all skill levels. The different levels and challenges presented in the game require players to think strategically and quickly adapt to changing circumstances, keeping them on their toes throughout the game.

                        As a sport, football needs no introduction. Futsal is just the mini version of football with slight tweaks and changes.
                        It is more intense and fast-paced than its counterpart. In recent years, this game has become one of the most popular
                        sports among the youth in both national and international contexts. After much anticipation, Notre Dame Outward Bound
                        Adventure Club adds back “Futsal” to the 5th season of the National Adventure Festival. So footy lovers, what are you
                        waiting for? Unleash your techniques and creativity where it matters the most.
