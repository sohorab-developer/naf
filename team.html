                            Tic Tac Toe is a game that we’ve all played in our school days. 
                            This is a short-timed game but it promises to give a lot of excitement. 
                            Basically one has to connect a line of three crosses/circles to win the game. 
                            The line can be cross-connected, vertically connected or horizontally connected. 
                            There will be a total of 9 boxes to put your circles/crosses. 
                            Instead of circles and crosses, we’ll be playing this game with training cones of different colors. 
                            Most importantly, this game will not be played with a pen and paper.
                            You’ve to work for it by hitting the ground running!

                        One team consists of 3 players(Cross-institution is allowed) and the players have to assemble behind a starting line before the start of a game. 
                        A box will accommodate 9 small boxes to put those cones in. 
                        That box will be set a bit far (100m) away from the starting point. 
                        The cones will be set on either side of the box.
                        Whenever the whistle/indication is given, participants have to run the length and put a particular color of cone into a box. 
                        When one contestant is done putting his/her cone in a box he/she will come back to the starting point as fast as possible and tag one of his/her teammate to enable that teammate to start running. 
                        The team managing to put 3 cones first in a line wins the game. 
                        There’s a simple yet key rule to this game, you can’t change the position of the cone once you’ve put it in a box. 
                        Also you can’t afford to change the position of a cone of the opposition. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There’ll be different segments for males and females for this intriguing game. So, Bring up your intensity game to the top, contestants!
